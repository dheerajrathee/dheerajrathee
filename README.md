### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Dr Dheeraj Rathee

A curious learner and a passionate implementer in the field of AI and Data Science. I keep looking for new possibilities to test the power of AI in different application areas within healthcare. 

Currently working on several innovative projects within healthcare field under my role of AI Data Scientist with <a href="https://www.provide.org.uk/" target="_blank">Provide CIC</a> (a not-for-profit Social Enterprise predominantly delivering healthcare services for NHS and LA across Essex, United Kingdom) and <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Essex</a>, Colchester, United Kingdom. It is real fun to work within an interdisciplinary team having people from psychology, academics, healthcare and business development.   

I have 7 years of experience in the domains of AI/ML and Data Science. Early phase of my AI and DA journey was majorly focused on Reasearch and Teaching while working in various academic positions (2011-2015) and then moved to core Research and Development while pursing my PhD at <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/departments/dvc/cebe/school-of-computing-engineering-and-intelligent-systems" target="_blank">School of Computing and Intelligent Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Ulster University</a>  (2015-2018). I graduated in early 2019 with my work published in several peer-reviewed journals. For the last three years, I have been involved in developing and deploying AI and DA based Enterprise Software Solutions for the healthcare domain working with a community interest company - Provide CIC and the University of Essex. 

My favourite pastime: reading (online blogs, books), watching Netflix, and spending time with my two supergirls :).
