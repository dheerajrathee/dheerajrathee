### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Dr Dheeraj Rathee

A curious learner and a passionate implementer in the field of AI and Data Science. I keep looking for new possibilities to test the power of AI in different application areas within healthcare. 

I am passionate about quality product development and implementing cutting-edge technologies from the fields of AI and Data Analytics to enhance product USP and value to customers. I got 8+ years of experience in Research and Development in various technology fields and am always up to learn, teach, inspire, and be inspired by talented teams and interesting businesses that foster innovation. I am the recipient of the Global Exceptional Talent endorsement for AI and Data Analytics from Tech Nation. 

Here are some key highlights about my professional journey:

# Proven leadership experience and successful history of delivery of scalable, AI-driven digital platforms for healthcare providers in the UK. 

# Experience in building cross-functional, lean, or agile technology teams using internal and external, on and offshore resources from 1-2 to 50 strong.

# Deep understanding of data protection and privacy compliance requirements. 

# Effective management of technology budgets and time frames

# Extensive knowledge of Software Design and Development, Solution Architecture, and Project Management methodologies coupled with organisation and planning skills to ensure on-time delivery, at reduced cost and high quality. 

# Experience in contributing to the funding rounds

# Connecting and engaging with key tech stakeholders, tech partners, and communities

My favourite pastime: reading (online blogs, books), watching Netflix, and spending time with my two supergirls :).
